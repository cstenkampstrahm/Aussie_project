	In making the shiny app, we realized that we wanted a map to be the main plot feature with inputs that the user specifies. 	A first ‘input’ of interest were the substrate, so we went through and determined how best to categorize and combine sample types that were collected (mostly so we had enough data points in each). We figured this would either be best to let the user specify via a drop down menu or a check box option. 	Another input of interest was the time the sample type was collected. We figured that since there are many different times of year represented for sample collection (ie the samples weren’t taken every year in October, for instance, but randomly across the year), we figured we would do just the year as the option. It appears that samples were taken one time in a given year, which was another reason we chose year. The best way for the user to specify the year was a slider input, so we made one of those.
